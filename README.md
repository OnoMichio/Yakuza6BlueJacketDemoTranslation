@CapitanRetraso for ReARMP so that I can edit the text more easily                                                                                                                 

@Kaplas80 for ParTool                                                                                                                                                               

@GarnetSunset for helping testing because I don't have a PS4 on hand and also for some db file stuffs (basically helping with translation)

@KHHsubs for the subs themselves!

@barnfind for the work on adding @HeartlessSeph's DOD to the mod to make it actually fun

~~and me obviously because I'm doing translation~~
