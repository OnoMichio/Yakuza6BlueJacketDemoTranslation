@CapitanRetraso for ReARMP so that I can edit the text more easily                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    @Kaplas80 for ParTool                                                                                                                                                                                                       
@GarnetSunset for helping testing because I don't have a PS4 on hand and also for some db file stuffs (basically helping with translation)
